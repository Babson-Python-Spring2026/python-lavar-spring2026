    "\n",
    "First * placement: When row = 3, we calculate leading_spaces = mid - row = 4 - 3 = 1. This means there's 1 space before the first star. As the row number increases, leading spaces decreases, which makes sense because the diamond is expanding outward and the stars move toward the edges.\n",
    "Second * symmetry: For this same row, inner_spaces = 2 * row - 1 = 2 * 3 - 1 = 5. So the line looks like: (1 space) * (5 spaces) *. The first star is at position 1 (after 1 leading space). The second star is at position 1 + 1 + 5 = 7 (1 leading space + first star + 5 inner spaces). Since the center of the diamond is at position 4, the stars are at positions 1 and 7, which are symmetric around the center (both are 3 positions away from position 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the tip row is a special case:\n",
    "The tip row needs to be special because when row = 0, the formula inner_spaces = 2 * row - 1 = -1 gives us a negative number. You can't have negative spaces between two stars, and it wouldn't make physical sense anyway - the diamond starts at a point, so the very top (and bottom) can only have one star. Without this special case, the code would try to print something impossible."

    "- Explain why using `dist = abs(mid - row)` automatically creates symmetry.\n",
    "- Explain what `inner_spaces < 0` means in terms of the *shape* of the diamond.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why dist = abs(mid - row) creates symmetry:\n",
    "Using dist = abs(mid - row) automatically creates symmetry because absolute value treats equal distances from the midpoint identically. For example, with height = 9 and mid = 4: when row = 2, dist = abs(4 - 2) = 2, and when row = 6, dist = abs(4 - 6) = 2. Both rows are 2 steps away from the middle, so they get the same dist value and therefore the same spacing calculations. This means the top and bottom halves mirror each other perfectly without needing separate loops - rows equidistant from the center automatically produce identical patterns.\n",
    "What inner_spaces < 0 means for the diamond shape:\n",
    "When inner_spaces < 0, it means we're at a \"tip\" of the diamond - either the very top or very bottom point. This happens when dist is at its maximum (equal to mid), which occurs at row = 0 (top tip) and row = height - 1 (bottom tip). At these extreme positions, the diamond hasn't expanded yet (or has collapsed back down), so there's no room for two stars with space between them. A negative value for inner_spaces is our mathematical signal that we're at a single-point location where only one star should appear."

For example, the sentence \"I love Python\" has 3 words and 2 spaces between them. Think of it like fence posts: if you have 3 fence posts, you need 2 sections of fence between them. So spaces + 1 = words. This works because we're guaranteed that spaces only appear between words, never at the beginning or end, and never doubled up. Each space marks a boundary between exactly two words.\n",

    "If the input were \"I  love  Python\" (with double spaces), we'd count 4 spaces. Using spaces + 1 = 5 would give us 5 words, but there are actually only 3 words. The invariant breaks because the formula assumes each space represents exactly one word boundary, but double spaces create \"empty\" boundaries that don't separate actual words. The formula overcounts because it's treating each individual space as meaningful, when some of those spaces are just extra whitespace."

    "ecrypt_map must be a bijection (one-to-one and onto) because every encrypted letter needs to map back to exactly one original letter. If two different letters (say A and B) both encrypted to the same letter (D), then when decrypting D, we wouldn't know whether it came from A or B - the information would be lost forever. \"One-to-one\" ensures each input maps to a unique output (no collisions). \"Onto\" ensures every letter can appear in encrypted text (the full alphabet is used). Together, this guarantees that encryption is reversible - every encrypted letter has exactly one original letter it came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why reversing the pairs makes decrypt_map the inverse of encrypt_map:\n",
    "\n",
    "When we build encrypt_map, we create pairs like 'A' → 'D', 'B' → 'E', etc. Building decrypt_map by reversing these pairs gives us 'D' → 'A', 'E' → 'B', etc. This makes decrypt_map the inverse because it literally undoes what encrypt_map does. If encrypt_map[L] = M, then decrypt_map[M] = L. Following a letter through encryption then decryption: L → encrypt_map[L] = M → decrypt_map[M] = L, we get back to where we started. The reversed pairs create a perfect \"undo\" function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why shift_norm = shift % 26 doesn't change the cipher:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are only 26 letters in the alphabet, shifting by 26 brings you back to where you started (like going around a clock). A shift of 29 means going around the entire alphabet once (26 letters) plus 3 more, which lands you in the same place as just shifting by 3. Mathematically: 29 = 26 + 3, so 29 % 26 = 3. The modulo operation removes complete \"laps\" around the alphabet that don't change the final position. This is why shift 27 = shift 1, shift 52 = shift 0, etc."
